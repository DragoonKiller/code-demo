## DragoonKiller's experiment code repository
DragoonKiller prefers simple single demo when learning APIs and other things. For many times, DK finds tutorial and documentation libraries provided are too difficult to understand, and the demo is complex or ambiguous with some important details lost. Some libraries does not provide tutorial or documentation. I'll make something for what I needed : a simple single file demo as a tutorial of some libraries, containing all necessary or important steps to make something run.

### Project Format
Manually copy-paste code and resources to a directories. DK does not want to make settings work for all kind of projects. A readme.md may provided inside each project directory describing all details to get it work.

### Platform specific
One project one platform. Turn to the corresponding platform when modifing the project. Or terrible problems of synchronization will take place soon.

### TODO
- [C#] Multi-Channel Signed Distance Field Generator.
- [C#] Flow Field Pathfinding (with polygon mesh).
